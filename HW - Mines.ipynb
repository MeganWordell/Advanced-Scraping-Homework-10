    "```python\n",
    "page.locator('#mstr92 input')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But because it's in an *iframe* you have to first grab the iframe, *then* grab the element. The documentation for playwright gives this as an example:\n",

    "### Second issue\n",
    "\n",
    "*You can't even use the `input` in this case*. It's a dumb system where you have to click a div that pretends to be a text input, [type on the keyboard](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-keyboard), then click some text that shows up and then click submit. It's *awful*.\n",
    "\n",

    "3. [Type on the keyboard](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-keyboard) \n",
    "4. Click the popup that suggests the mine you're interested in\n",
    "5. Click the submit button\n",
